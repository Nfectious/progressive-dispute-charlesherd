Got it. Here’s how you counter a Reservation of Rights (ROR) letter in Tennessee—fast, sharp, and by the book.

\# ✅ Tactical Response to Reservation of Rights (Rental Car Incident)



\### 1. \*\*Summary of Situation\*\*



\* Progressive sent you a Reservation of Rights (ROR) regarding the June rental car accident.

\* You paid rental costs out-of-pocket because Progressive declared your Honda a total loss and you were stranded.

\* Progressive is trying to limit/deny coverage because (a) you were allegedly removed from the policy by your mother, and (b) they claim uncertainty on coverage.

\* They’ve left you without reimbursement or settlement on \*\*either the rental or the Honda\*\* for months.



---



\### 2. \*\*Key Issues in Their Position\*\*



\* \*\*Lack of Notice:\*\* If your mother removed you from the policy, Progressive was obligated under \*\*Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-1302\*\* to provide notice of cancellation/nonrenewal to the named insured. If you weren’t notified in writing, the removal is not enforceable.

\* \*\*Failure to Settle Promptly:\*\* \*\*Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105(3)\*\* requires insurers to act in good faith and promptly settle claims once liability is clear. They’ve had your car since May 8 and admitted it’s a total loss by May 16.

\* \*\*Reservation of Rights Tactic:\*\* An ROR is not a denial—it’s a placeholder. You must respond, or they’ll later argue you “acquiesced” to their reservation.

\* \*\*Rental Coverage:\*\* Their June 23 letter to the state admits you had \\$1,200 in rental coverage already paid, but it doesn’t excuse leaving you stranded after taking your car.



---



\### 3. \*\*Legal Basis\*\*



\* \*\*Notice Failures:\*\* Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-1302 → cancellation/removal must be in writing, mailed to insured, with at least 10 days’ notice. If you never received that, Progressive cannot rely on it.

\* \*\*Bad Faith Statute:\*\* Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105 → if insurer fails to pay within 60 days of demand without good cause, you can seek \*\*25% penalty + attorney’s fees\*\*.

\* \*\*Unfair Trade Practices:\*\* Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-104 \& § 56-8-105 → misrepresentation, unreasonable delays, or failing to provide written policy provisions are “unfair claims practices.”

\### 4. \*\*Action Plan\*\*



\*\*Step 1 – Respond in Writing to the ROR\*\*



\* Acknowledge receipt.

\* Dispute any claim of valid removal without written notice.

\* Assert your rights under \*\*§ 56-7-1302\*\* and \*\*§ 56-7-105\*\*.

\* Demand reimbursement of rental paid out-of-pocket and immediate settlement of Honda claim.

\* Put them on a 15-day clock to cure.



\*\*Step 2 – File with TN Dept. of Commerce \& Insurance (TDCI)\*\*



\* Attach the ROR, your demand response, and proof of rental payments.

\* Note their delay (over 90 days since May 8) violates fair claims handling.



\*\*Step 3 – Preserve Attorney Leverage\*\*



\* Copy your response into a draft for an attorney: emphasize failure to notify, bad faith delays, and out-of-pocket damages.

\*\*Subject:\*\* Response to Reservation of Rights – Claim #25-822866566



To Whom It May Concern,



I acknowledge receipt of your Reservation of Rights letter dated August 14, 2025. I dispute the basis of your reservation and assert my rights under Tennessee law:



1\. I never received any written notice of cancellation or removal from my policy as required under Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-1302. Any claim that I was removed is invalid without such notice.

2\. You declared my 2020 Honda CR-V a total loss on May 16, 2025 and took possession of it on May 8. Since that time, you have left me stranded without settlement, in direct violation of Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105(3).

3\. I was forced to pay rental expenses out of pocket because of your failure to provide transportation after removing my vehicle. I demand reimbursement of all documented rental charges.

4\. Pursuant to Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105, I hereby make formal demand for payment. If settlement is not made within 15 days, I will pursue statutory bad-faith remedies, including the 25% penalty, interest, and attorney’s fees.



This letter is not a waiver of any rights under Tennessee law or my policy.



Respectfully,

Charles Travis Herd
