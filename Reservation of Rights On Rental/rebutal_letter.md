\## 1. Overview of Facts



\- April 20, 2025: Single-vehicle loss reported; vehicle location confirmed.  

\- May 6, 2025: Total-loss declaration by Kim Brooks; agent instructs that surety bonds are not accepted.  

\- May 19–20, 2025: I release vehicle to Caliber Collision for transport; Progressive takes possession and delivers it to Copart.  

\- May 22, 2025: Rental car coverage abruptly cut off mid-claim; I incur over \\$400 in out-of-pocket rental expenses.  

\- May 27–June 3, 2025: Progressive demands a surety bond and title despite already having the vehicle and voided original title.  

\- June–July 2025: Progressive admits no written policy exists on bonded titles; continues to send contradictory instructions.  

\- June 23, 2025: Progressive misrepresents my cooperation to the State of Tennessee’s Department of Commerce \& Insurance.

\## 2. Contradictions and Misrepresentations



\- Surety Bond Policy: Agent Kim Brooks denies acceptance; Supervisor Matt Perkins later demands it; admission in July that no policy exists.  

\- Total Loss Status: Declared and then denied orally; paperwork proves total loss.  

\- Stolen-Vehicle Allegation: Budget Rent-A-Car “missing vehicle” claim based on a phone call, not a database search or police report.  

\- Misleading State Officials: False statements to TDCI accusing me of non-cooperation.  



---



\## 3. Applicable Tennessee Law



\- T.C.A. § 55-3-212: Original title void upon total-loss declaration; insurer bears responsibility for obtaining salvage title.  

\- T.C.A. § 55-3-211(9)(A): When an insurer declares a total loss and takes possession, the insurer must secure the salvage title.  

\- T.C.A. § 56-8-104: Prohibits misrepresentation and unfair claims settlement practices.  

\- T.C.A. § 56-8-105: Requires insurers to process claims promptly and fairly.  

\- T.C.A. § 56-7-105: Allows a 25% penalty plus attorney fees for claim payments delayed over 60 days.

\## 4. Demand for Immediate Resolution



1\. Obtain and forward the salvage title for VIN 2HKRW1H23LH404578 without further delay.  

2\. Pay the actual cash value (ACV) of the totaled 2020 Honda CR-V as of the date of loss.  

3\. Reimburse all out-of-pocket rental expenses incurred after May 22, 2025, totaling \\$400+.  

4\. Pay a statutory penalty of 25% of the ACV for delayed payment under T.C.A. § 56-7-105.  

5\. Reimburse any reasonable attorney fees and costs associated with enforcing these rights.  



Please confirm in writing by August 28, 2025, that these demands will be met. If I do not receive your full compliance by that date, I will pursue all available legal remedies, including filing a complaint with the Tennessee Department of Commerce \& Insurance and seeking judicial relief for bad-faith practices and statutory penalties.

\## 5. Preservation of Rights



I remain open to an amicable resolution but will hold Progressive fully responsible for any further delays, misrepresentations, or additional hardships resulting from this claim. All prior communications, documents, and claim-related expenses are preserved for potential legal and regulatory review.



Sincerely,  



&nbsp; 

Charles Travis Herd
