Here’s the tactical breakdown of the Tennessee statutes that Progressive’s handling of your claim is colliding with. These are the exact weapons you can cite when filing back with TDCI or in a bad faith suit.

✅ Relevant Tennessee Statutes & Where Progressive is Out of Compliance

Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105 – Bad Faith Refusal to Pay

Requirement: Insurer must pay a valid claim within 60 days after written demand, unless a good faith dispute exists. Failure triggers a penalty of up to 25% of the claim amount, plus attorney’s fees.

Violation in Your Case: You issued formal written demands in late May. It’s now August. Progressive still hasn’t paid or provided valid grounds. They moved goalposts (surety bond/no bond, total loss/not total loss) instead of resolving.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-104 – Unfair Trade Practices (Misrepresentation & False Info)

Requirement: Insurers may not misrepresent pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions.

Violation in Your Case:

Progressive claimed Budget reported the car “missing” and “sold to an unknown party”, but VIN checks and law enforcement searches showed no such record.

Matt Perkins sent you a screenshot with a Carfax customer service number, presented as proof of the “missing” report. That is false or misleading evidence.

Kim Brooks told you Progressive does not accept surety bonds, then later demanded one. That’s internal misrepresentation of their own policies.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105 – Unfair Claim Settlement Practices

Requirement: Insurers must:

Promptly acknowledge claims.

Conduct reasonable investigations.

Attempt good faith settlement where liability is clear.

Not delay by demanding irrelevant or duplicative information.

Violation in Your Case:

Repeated contradictory instructions on surety bonds and title created artificial delay.

Declaring the car a total loss, taking possession, then backtracking.

Repeated requests for accident statements you already provided.

Failure to provide documentation of the “missing” report after multiple requests.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 55-3-212 – Salvage & Total Loss Titles

Requirement: Once a vehicle is declared a total loss, the original title is void. The insurer must apply for a salvage title or certificate if they take possession.

Violation in Your Case: Progressive took possession of your car and called it a total loss. Instead of applying for salvage title as required, they pushed you to obtain a title via surety bond — legally impossible once a total loss is declared.

Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-2-305 & § 56-2-308 – TDCI Oversight

Requirement: The Tennessee Department of Commerce & Insurance can sanction insurers for engaging in practices contrary to insurance law or unfairly discriminatory practices.

Violation in Your Case: By collecting premiums on a car they now claim was “sold to an unknown party” in 2024, Progressive was either (1) insuring a vehicle it admits you didn’t own, or (2) making false statements to regulators. Either path triggers regulatory scrutiny.

⚔️ Bottom Line
Progressive is potentially in violation of at least four separate Tennessee statutory requirements:

§ 56-7-105 (failure to pay within 60 days),

§ 56-8-104 (false/misleading info),

§ 56-8-105 (unfair claim handling),

§ 55-3-212 (improper salvage/title handling).
