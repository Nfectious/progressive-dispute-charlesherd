I looked further into Progressives letter to the State of Tennessee's Mr. Bruce Moore.
 - I found several discrepincies and even more contradictions that further point to Progressive lying and providing mis information or fruad.
 - This is from Copilet Converstaion that is in the same folder as progressives letter to the state and this was at the end.

`Recommended Next Steps

1. **Draft & Send a Formal Rebuttal** to both Stanley Coker and Bruce Moore.  
   - Demand documentation for every “database search” and alleged sale.  
   - Cite your clean VIN reports and law-enforcement checks.  
   - Reiterate that, per **T.C.A. § 55-3-212**, they must process the salvage title and pay your ACV.

2. **Escalate Your Regulatory Complaint**  
   - Attach Coker’s letter as evidence of misrepresentation.  
   - File an amended complaint with TDCI, NAIC, and the Tennessee Attorney General.

3. **Contact Budget Directly**  
   - Request written confirmation that they never listed the car as missing or sold it on June 28, 2024.  
   - Use their statement to further discredit Progressive’s false narrative.

4. **Prepare for Bad-Faith Action**  
   - Keep all correspondence, text logs, VIN reports, and rental receipts.  
   - Consult a consumer-protection attorney to discuss a civil suit under Tennessee’s bad-faith statutes.

By exposing these fabrications, you force Progressive to either admit their misconduct or comply with their legal obligations. Let me know if you’d like a draft rebuttal letter tailored to Coker’s false assertions.

## Recommendations for Policyholders Facing Similar Scenarios

1. **Preserve all forms of communication** with the insurer (emails, recorded calls, claim status notices, total loss paperwork, title/bond applications).
2. **Request written justification from the insurer for any additional documentation or delay**, citing applicable state law (including Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105 and UCSPA provisions).
3. **Contact the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance for regulatory assistance** if claim resolution is delayed or unfairly denied.
4. **Consult with legal aid or a qualified attorney** familiar with Tennessee insurance and disability accommodation law, especially when facing mobility, health, or access barriers; rural clinics and regional legal aid centers can often assist.
5. **If a surety bond must be obtained, ensure you maintain possession of the vehicle and abide by Department of Revenue guidance**—though, as demonstrated, once car custody has transferred to the insurer, this becomes their responsibility.

**In closing, this case underscores the crucial importance of insurer compliance with both the letter and spirit of Tennessee insurance, salvage, and consumer protection law. When a total loss occurs and the vehicle is surrendered under insurer instructions, it is unlawful and unreasonable to expect an insured—especially one with significant personal hardships—to fulfill procedural steps that are institutionally and practically reserved for the salvage vehicle’s new owner: the insurance company itself.**
