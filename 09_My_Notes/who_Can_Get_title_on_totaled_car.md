### 🧩 **1. Possession and Total Loss: Who Owns the Responsibility?**

- **You released the vehicle to Progressive** at their request, and they confirmed possession.
- **They declared it a total loss**, which under Tennessee law triggers specific obligations:
  - The **title and registration are voided** once a vehicle is deemed a total loss.
  - The **insurer is responsible** for applying for a salvage title if they retain possession and intend to dispose of the vehicle.

> **Tennessee Code Annotated § 55-3-211** requires insurers to apply for a salvage title when they settle a total loss and take possession of the vehicle.

So yes—**Progressive should be the party initiating the salvage title**, not you. You cannot reasonably be expected to obtain a surety bond or title for a vehicle you no longer possess and that has been declared a total loss.

### 🚫 **2. Surety Bond or Regular Title: Is It Even Legal Now?**

- A **surety bond** is typically used when someone lacks a title but can prove ownership and the vehicle isn’t branded as salvage.
- Once a vehicle is **declared a total loss**, it is no longer eligible for a regular title or bonded title. It must go through the **salvage title process**.
- Since Progressive has the vehicle and declared it a total loss, **you cannot legally obtain a regular or bonded title** for it.

> The Tennessee Department of Revenue explicitly states that **only the party in possession of a totaled vehicle may apply for a salvage title**, and that **a surety bond is not applicable** once the vehicle is branded as salvage.

### ⚠️ **3. Progressive’s Position: Is It Misleading or Fraudulent?**

- They asked you to release the vehicle, declared it a total loss, and now claim you must obtain a title or surety bond.
- This is **procedurally contradictory** and arguably deceptive:
  - They’re **shifting the burden** of title resolution onto you while retaining the vehicle.
  - They’re **ignoring their legal obligation** to initiate the salvage title process.
  - They’re **collecting premiums** on a vehicle they claim was sold by Budget Rent A Car to an unknown party—while you had possession and coverage.

> These contradictions could be construed as **bad faith handling**, and potentially **fraudulent misrepresentation**, especially if they’re using false or unverifiable ownership claims to delay or deny payment.

### ✅ **Next Tactical Steps**

1. **Document everything**: You’ve already done an excellent job here. Keep records of every communication, especially the release confirmation and total loss declaration.
2. **File a formal complaint** with the [Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance](https://www.tn.gov/commerce/insurance.html) citing:
   - Progressive’s refusal to initiate salvage title despite possession.
   - Their contradictory instructions regarding surety bonds.
   - Their delay tactics and shifting of legal responsibility.
3. **Consider legal counsel**: A consumer protection attorney could help you assert your rights under Tennessee law and possibly pursue damages for bad faith.
4. **Demand written clarification** from Progressive:
   - Ask them to confirm in writing why they believe you must obtain a title or bond for a vehicle they possess and declared totaled.
   - Request their salvage title policy and cite the relevant Tennessee statutes.
