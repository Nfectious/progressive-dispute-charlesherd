# Comprehensive Report: History and Analysis of the Stanley Coker Letter to the State of Tennessee Regarding a 2020 Honda CR-V, Progressive, Surety Bonds, and Salvage Title Issues

---

## Introduction

The case involving Stanley Coker and his 2020 Honda CR-V is a multifaceted situation entwining Tennessee vehicle title laws, insurance claim procedures, and the practical realities facing rural residents with significant health challenges. Mr. Coker acquired a 2020 Honda CR-V but faced persistent challenges in securing a clear title, requiring him to initiate the surety bond process. In April 2024, before the title matter was resolved, the car was involved in a single-car accident. As the insured, Mr. Coker had maintained coverage with Progressive since early 2023. After the accident, Progressive assumed possession of the vehicle, initially declared it a total loss, then vacillated on this determination, and ultimately insisted that the insured obtain a title or a surety bond to proceed with claim resolution. This report provides a rigorously detailed and thoroughly researched narrative and analysis on the sequence of events, relevant legal frameworks, the responsibilities of all parties, and the broader impact on the policyholder. Insights are drawn from Tennessee statutes, the Department of Revenue, Progressive’s published policies, industry regulatory guidance, and multiple consumer resources. The structure addresses: (1) the accident and claim timeline, (2) Progressive’s communications and policy inconsistencies, (3) the legalities of surety bonds and title requirements in Tennessee, (4) total loss and salvage title procedures, (5) the responsibilities of insurance carriers post-total loss, and (6) the direct impact on the insured, especially considering rural healthcare access. Each section concludes with in-depth discussion, using available web sources and state frameworks.

## 1. Accident and Claim Timeline

### Summary Table: Timeline of Events and Key Claims

| Date         | Event                                                        | Key Details/Claim                                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Early 2023   | Progressive policy inception                                 | 2020 Honda CR-V insured by the policyholder                           |
| Pre-April 2024 | Title procurement difficulties; surety bond initiated         | Owner unable to secure title, sought to obtain a bonded title         |
| April 2024   | Single-car accident occurs                                   | Owner actively working on surety bond at the time                     |
| April–May 2024 | Claim reported; vehicle transferred to Progressive’s body shop | Progressive informed that title was not available; bond in process    |
| Early May 2024 | Claim handler (Kim) states surety bonds not accepted          | Car declared total loss by Progressive                                |
| Following days | Progressive requests signed release for vehicle to Copart      | Owner complies; Progressive confirms receipt and transfer             |
| Later May 2024 | Status reversal: claim not totaled, then reverted to total loss | Progressive claim status and instructions inconsistent                |
| May 2025     | Supervisor (Matt Perkins) insists surety bond or title is required | Owner requests copy of company surety bond policy                     |
| July 2025    | Progressive states no such surety bond policy exists           | Adjuster insists on surety bond or title                              |
| July-Aug 2025 | Progressive enforces 30-day rental limit, requests vehicle rental return | Claim remains unresolved; policyholder left without transport         |
| Aug 18, 2025 | As of this date, vehicle in Progressive/Copart’s possession    | Owner holds total loss paperwork; no progress on title issue          |

The above table captures the chronology and key claims and communications relevant to Mr. Coker’s insurance claim, highlighting the procedural confusion, shifting requirements, and the persistent impasse around the surety bond and salvage title process.

The series of events reveal several crucial junctures: the policyholder’s inability to secure a traditional title, the in-progress bonded title application at the time of loss, repeated notifications to Progressive, and the insurer’s subsequent decisions, including possession transfer, ambiguous settlement status, and ultimately the imposition of requirements that appear misaligned with Tennessee’s title and insurance settlement statutes. This timeline establishes the factual context for deeper legal and procedural analysis in subsequent sections.

## 2. Progressive’s Communications and Policy Inconsistencies

Progressive’s handling of this claim demonstrates significant inconsistencies that have contributed to the protracted nature of the dispute. At the outset, the company’s claim representative Kim acknowledged the lack of a title and was told by the insured that a surety bond was being pursued. Kim then advised Progressive would not accept surety bonds and soon after determined the vehicle was a total loss—an evaluation congruent with state law for vehicles whose damage exceeds 75% of their value. Progressive then asked for a release of the vehicle to Copart, a prominent salvage auction company working with most national insurers.

Shortly thereafter, Progressive reversed its determination, implying the car might not actually be a total loss. Yet the insured had already relinquished control to Copart, acting in reliance on Progressive’s instructions. This about-face is problematic: state law and most insurance policy manuals stipulate that once a vehicle is transferred to the insurer as total loss property, the insurance settlement process (and transfer of salvage interests) should be expeditious and clear.

Later, when supervisory staff (Matt Perkins) re-engaged, they insisted on the submission of a title or surety bond—despite previously asserting that surety bonds were not accepted. The policyholder’s astute request for Progressive’s internal policy on surety bonds yielded confirmation from Progressive that no such policy document exists. Yet, the company continued to state—without apparent legal basis—that the insured must provide either a bonded title or an original title to proceed.

This uncoordinated series of instructions and reversals violates insurance best practices as established by Tennessee’s Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (UCSPA) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105) and the general duty of good faith (Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105), which require (among other things) prompt, clear communications and consistent policy application. Tennessee law strictly prohibits insurance companies from misrepresenting claim requirements or failing to provide a reasonable explanation for claim denials or requests for additional documentation. Where inconsistencies cause procedural gridlock in settling a claim, regulatory scrutiny and, if warranted, legal action by policyholders may follow.

Furthermore, Progressive’s imposition of a 30-day rental car limit—while simultaneously refusing to settle or process the total loss—is at odds with industry norms for ‘loss of use’ or ‘rental reimbursement’ coverage in cases where claim investigation delays are not the fault of the insured.

In sum, the communications from Progressive vacillated between non-acceptance and insistence on a surety bond and failed to acknowledge the insurer’s statutory responsibilities following the declaration and possession of a total loss vehicle under Tennessee law. The resulting ambiguity left the insured without a clear path forward even though the car was no longer in their custody and Progressive had all relevant documentation.

## 3. Surety Bond and Title Requirements in Tennessee

### 3.1 Tennessee Surety Bond Basics

A surety bond, in the context of Tennessee vehicle titling law, serves as a form of proof-of-ownership for situations where an applicant cannot provide a standard certificate of title. Tennessee accepts surety bonds as an established pathway for owners of vehicles less than 30 years old and with a fair market value exceeding $3,000 who lack proper title evidence, provided the car is not reported stolen and there are no existing liens.

To initiate the bonded title process in Tennessee, the applicant must:
- Submit a Surety Bond Application and proof of vehicle value (typically from reputable guides like Kelley Blue Book).
- Provide a bill of sale from the last registered owner or, if unavailable, a notarized statement addressing the lack of title.
- Secure either a personal (with two Tennessee landowners as sureties) or a corporate surety bond from an insurance/bonding company licensed in Tennessee.
- The bond amount is one and one-half times (1.5x) the vehicle’s appraised fair market value.

Once approved, the bonded title allows for the registration and legal transfer of ownership. The bond itself serves as indemnity for three years and may be called upon if a superior claimant appears. The process is clearly outlined by the Tennessee Department of Revenue and is designed to assure both the state and any potential claimants that the bonded applicant is the legitimate owner.

### 3.2 Bonded Titles and Insurance Claims

What complicates cases like Mr. Coker’s is that the car was already involved in a claim—indeed, had been totaled and physically transferred to the insurer—before the surety bond process could be concluded. Under these circumstances, Tennessee law does not charge the insurance policyholder with an obligation to complete the surety bond process once the car has been classified as a total loss and relinquished per the insurer’s request. Instead, the insurer, now in actual and constructive possession, becomes the appropriate party to resolve any title issues necessary to transfer or dispose of the vehicle as salvage.

### 3.3 Policyholder’s Dilemma

Despite clear statutory procedures, insurance carriers in Tennessee sometimes demand that claimants procure a surety bond to facilitate a total loss settlement even after assuming physical custody of the vehicle. This may occur as a risk management measure, but it is generally inconsistent with both the statute’s intent and industry standards, as qualifying for a surety bond while not in physical possession of the car is both functionally and legally impracticable. The Tennessee Department of Revenue acknowledges that only vehicle owners (who can deliver the vehicle) or insurance companies that hold the salvage can properly obtain such bond-based titles following total loss, salvage, or non-repairable declarations.

## 4. Total Loss Procedures in Tennessee: Law and Practice

### 4.1 Tennessee’s Total Loss Threshold and Requirements

Tennessee law defines a “total loss” as a vehicle whose repair costs (parts and labor) meet or exceed 75% of its pre-accident actual cash value (ACV) (Tenn. Code Ann. § 55-3-211). Insurers must determine this value using nationally recognized guides and fair market comparables, accounting for mileage and condition. Once declared a total loss, the following steps are prescribed by law:
1. The insurance company notifies the Department of Revenue and surrenders the original title.
2. The title and registration are immediately void upon this declaration.
3. The Department issues a salvage certificate, prohibiting the car’s use on public roads.
4. The car can only be transferred as salvage, rebuilt, or scrapped.

This process is mandatory and aims to ensure that the total loss vehicle cannot be illicitly retitled or resold to an unsuspecting buyer without full disclosure of its salvage status.

### 4.2 Carrier Obligations

Upon declaring a total loss and assuming possession, the insurer is obligated to promptly process the claim by either:
- Paying the ACV (less deductibles) to the policyholder and becoming the vehicle’s new owner of record, or
- Authorizing the policyholder to retain the salvage with an appropriate ACV deduction.

To complete the process, the insurance carrier—not the insured—must resolve any open title issues, including resort to the surety bond pathway if title paperwork is defective, lost, or missing. This is particularly clear in cases where the vehicle is under control of the carrier and is being disposed of via local salvage auction (Copart), as is routine industry practice.

### 4.3 Salvage and Rebuilt Titles

If the car is subsequently repaired, the new owner (often a salvage dealer or individual buyer through Copart) may pursue a rebuilt title. This requires passing an anti-theft and safety inspection, providing certified receipts for parts used, photographs of the repaired and wrecked vehicle, and paying a $75 conversion fee. The rebuilt title permanently brands the vehicle, ensuring future disclosures.

## 5. Salvage Title and Insurance Carrier Responsibilities

Progressive, as the insurance company that declared the 2020 Honda CR-V a total loss and gained physical possession, became responsible under Tennessee law for:
- Surrendering the original title (or, if unavailable, providing sworn statements and/or pursuing a bonded title on its own),
- Applying for the salvage certificate, and
- Disposing of the vehicle through legally authorized means, typically a licensed salvage auction like Copart.

Salvage pools such as Copart work closely with insurers to ensure proper titling, transfer, and subsequent sale of total loss vehicles. Tennessee title law specifically allows for salvage pool operators to be issued lien-free salvage titles by the Department of Revenue when the insurer has requested possession and statutory notice requirements to the prior owner are met.

It is generally not considered reasonable (under the UCSPA or the duty of good faith in Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105) for an insurer to demand a surety bond or a title from a policyholder who, at the carrier’s express instruction, has surrendered the car, lost legal control, and holds only evidence of the total loss declaration and claim paperwork. If an insurer cannot produce the title due to missing paperwork or defects prior to loss (as in the Coker case), the proper regulatory response is for the carrier to work directly with the Department of Revenue, utilizing its own surety bond resources or by providing necessary affidavits to obtain a salvage title and complete settlement.

## 6. Analysis of Copart Vehicle Auction and Possession Transfer

Copart facilitates the legal transfer, storage, and sale of salvage vehicles on behalf of insurers nationwide. Once a vehicle is physically delivered to Copart and the insurer has notified Copart of its intent to dispose, Copart acts as an intermediary to process the paperwork with the Tennessee Department of Revenue. If a title or documentation is missing or damaged, Copart—on behalf of the original vehicle owner (now typically the insurer)—may, under specific Tennessee rules, request a lien-free salvage title, provided statutory notice requirements to the former owner are met.

Notably:
- Policyholders who have released the vehicle and executed total loss paperwork are generally no longer the "owner of record" for purposes of titling or bonded title claims.
- Insurers are equipped to provide evidence of settlement, loss payment details, and sworn documentation, enabling Copart and the Department of Revenue to issue a salvage certificate or a rebuilt title if the car is subsequently repaired.

After title transfer and possession by Copart, the policyholder's obligation ends except where express fraud or misrepresentation can be established. If, as in Mr. Coker’s case, the insurer has not processed the title despite clear authority and documentary evidence to do so, the policyholder is left in limbo—unable to return to the bonded title process because physical custody of the vehicle is now with Copart and/or the insurer.

## 7. Vehicle Title and Registration Requirements: Tennessee Department of Revenue

Vehicle registration and title in Tennessee is regulated by the Tennessee Department of Revenue. To register a car or transfer a title:
- The applicant must provide proof of ownership (standard title, or surety bond if title is lost/missing).
- Registration, tax, and applicable titling fees must be paid.
- Salvage certificate vehicles cannot be registered for road use until re-certified and issued a rebuilt title.

A bill of sale alone does not confer ownership rights sufficient for registration; a title (or bonded title) is required. However, once a car has been branded as salvage following total loss, new registration is only possible after the completion of the rebuilt title process and a successful inspection by the Department’s Anti-Theft Unit.

## 8. Insurance Regulatory Obligations in Tennessee

Tennessee law imposes exacting requirements on insurance companies regarding fair and timely claims settlement. The key statutes are:
- Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-8-105 (Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act): Prohibits misrepresentation, unreasonable delays, and failure to provide basis for denial or claim requirements.
- Tenn. Code Ann. § 56-7-105: Allows for penalties (up to 25% of the claim) and attorney’s fees against insurers who act in bad faith in delaying or refusing claims settlement.

Progressive, as a regulated insurer in Tennessee, is therefore obligated to:
- Provide timely, accurate explanations for any requests regarding claim documentation.
- Not require documentation or steps from the policyholder that are outside of their capacity (i.e., demanding proof of title or surety bond after vehicle surrender).
- Comply with all good faith settlement provisions when liability is clear (as in cases where a vehicle is declared totaled and the claim is otherwise uncontested).

If a carrier fails on these fronts, policyholders may file complaints with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which has the power to investigate and, if necessary, sanction insurers for recurrent bad faith or unfair practices.

## 9. Impact of Vehicle Loss and Claim Delays on Policyholders with Medical Conditions in Rural Tennessee

### 9.1 Rural Mobility and Health Disparities

Residents of rural Tennessee, such as the policyholder in this case, experience unique and well-documented barriers to mobility and healthcare access. Limited public transportation, long distances to care providers, and frequent healthcare workforce shortages mean that dependable private transportation is vital for those with medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and congestive heart failure. The sudden loss of a vehicle—compounded by insurance claim delays—can result in missed medical appointments, delays in critical prescription refills or therapies, and significantly heightened health risks.

National data underscore that rural persons with chronic conditions face substantially higher disability rates and financial obstacles in accessing both healthcare and alternative transportation, which can worsen health outcomes and even life expectancy disparities.

### 9.2 The Administrative Burden on Vulnerable Policyholders

Lengthy, unclear claim settlement processes and shifting documentation requirements disproportionately burden those with significant health or mobility issues. In Mr. Coker’s case, the compounded effects of his chronic diseases, rural location, and lack of replacement transportation represent not just an inconvenience but a genuine threat to health and independence—particularly as the claim remains unresolved for months and, as of August 2025, the insured continues to pay for a policy with no usable vehicle.

Progressive’s handling—imposing repeated administrative demands (insurance paperwork, title, or surety bond requirements) on an individual with demonstrable incapacity and lack of practical means to comply—is at odds with established principles of disability accommodation and best practices for insurance policyholder service.

## 10. Steps and Legal Requirements for Obtaining a Rebuilt Title

Should an owner (or subsequent salvage purchaser) desire to return a salvage vehicle to the road in Tennessee, a strict process must be followed:
1. Obtain a salvage certificate (issued after total loss claim).
2. Fully repair the vehicle to manufacturer and state standards.
3. Compile comprehensive documentation—parts receipts, before-and-after photographs, proof of parts legitimacy.
4. Submit an application for vehicle identification certification and pay a $75 (individuals) or $85 (dealers) inspection fee.
5. Pass state anti-theft and safety inspection; only then is a rebuilt title issued, permanently branded according to law.

It is crucial to reiterate: Only those with lawful title or ownership (i.e., typically the insurer after payoff, or a subsequent salvage buyer) can initiate and complete this rebuilt title process, further underscoring why demanding a salvage or rebuilt title from a former insured who has ceded possession is legally unsound.

## Conclusions and Key Takeaways

- **Progressive’s settlement handling in this specific case demonstrates numerous inconsistencies and misapplications of both Tennessee insurance law and vehicle titling regulations**. After declaring the car a total loss and obtaining possession, the company’s continued insistence on the policyholder procuring a surety bond or title—while simultaneously admitting to a lack of written policy and previously refusing to accept a bond—is procedurally and arguably legally indefensible.
  
- **Under Tennessee law, when an insurance carrier declares a vehicle a total loss and assumes possession, it is the carrier’s obligation to obtain a salvage certificate or pursue a bonded title if no original title is available**. Instructing a former owner who is now divested of both car and documentation to obtain a bonded title is both futile and unsupported by the Department of Revenue’s own process guidance.
  
- **The delay and ambiguity have left the policyholder in ongoing hardship**. The withdrawal of the rental vehicle despite an open claim and the ongoing requirement to maintain premium payments for an unusable vehicle—especially for someone with severe medical needs living in rural Tennessee—raises significant concerns under Tennessee’s Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act and disability rights best practices.
  
- **The correct legal and procedural route** is for Progressive to act as the (constructive) new owner of the salvage vehicle, work directly with Copart and the Department of Revenue to resolve outstanding title questions, and issue the claim settlement to the former owner per the terms of the policy and state law.
  
- **Should a regulatory complaint be filed, Mr. Coker should reference both Tennessee Code Ann. § 56-8-105 and relevant Department of Revenue documentation, and provide evidence of the claim timeline, including all communications, the total loss declaration, and proof of vehicle release to Progressive/Copart**. Further legal aid and disability accommodations should also be considered given the health and rural access implications.
