Absolutely, Travis. You‚Äôve been more than patient, and the facts show a clear pattern of delay, contradiction, and procedural failure on Progressive‚Äôs part. I‚Äôll draft both a **formal complaint** for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance and a **final demand letter** to Progressive. These will be assertive, legally grounded, and emotionally resonant‚Äîreflecting your persistence and the toll this has taken.

## üìÑ Formal Complaint to the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance

```text
To Whom It May Concern,

I am filing a formal complaint against Progressive Insurance regarding their handling of my total loss claim for a 2020 Honda CR-V insured under my policy since early 2023. The vehicle was involved in a single-car accident in April 2024 in Tennessee. Progressive declared the vehicle a total loss, requested that I release it to them, and confirmed possession. Despite this, they have refused to proceed with the claim resolution, citing my inability to provide a title or surety bond.

This position is legally and procedurally untenable. Under Tennessee law (TCA ¬ß 55-3-211), once an insurer declares a vehicle a total loss and takes possession, they are responsible for initiating the salvage title process. Progressive has ignored this obligation and instead shifted the burden onto me‚Äîdespite the fact that I no longer possess the vehicle and cannot legally obtain a title or bond for a totaled car.

Additionally, Progressive has provided contradictory and misleading information:
- Initially stating they do not accept surety bonds, then later demanding one.
- Claiming the vehicle was sold by Budget Rent A Car to an unknown party while I had possession and was paying premiums.
- Sending communications referencing a ‚Äúmissing rental‚Äù with a Carfax customer service number, which appears to be a misrepresentation.

I have been without a vehicle since May 2025, despite maintaining insurance coverage. I live in a rural area and suffer from multiple health conditions including MS and congestive heart failure. Progressive‚Äôs failure to resolve this claim has caused significant hardship.

I respectfully request that your office investigate Progressive‚Äôs handling of this claim, their failure to comply with salvage title obligations, and their use of misleading communications. I am seeking enforcement of Tennessee insurance regulations and consumer protection statutes.

Sincerely,  
Travis [Last Name]

## üì¨ Final Demand Letter to Progressive Insurance

```text
To: Claims Department, Progressive Insurance  
Attn: Stanley Coker, Matt Perkins, and Matt Brooks

Subject: Final Demand for Resolution of Total Loss Claim ‚Äì 2020 Honda CR-V

Dear Progressive Team,

This letter serves as my final demand for resolution of my total loss claim regarding the 2020 Honda CR-V insured under my policy since early 2023. The vehicle was involved in an accident in April 2024 and subsequently declared a total loss by your team. At your request, I released the vehicle to Progressive, and you confirmed possession.

Despite this, you have refused to proceed with the claim, citing my inability to provide a title or surety bond. This is a misapplication of Tennessee law. Under TCA ¬ß 55-3-211, the insurer is responsible for obtaining a salvage title when a vehicle is declared a total loss and taken into possession. Your continued insistence that I obtain documentation for a vehicle I no longer possess‚Äîand which you deemed totaled‚Äîis both unreasonable and unlawful.

Furthermore, your communications have included:
- Contradictory statements about your surety bond policy.
- A claim that Budget Rent A Car sold the vehicle to an unknown party while I had possession and was paying premiums.
- A misleading image referencing a ‚Äúmissing rental‚Äù with a Carfax customer service number.

These actions appear to constitute bad faith, misrepresentation, and a failure to comply with Tennessee insurance regulations. I have been without a vehicle since May 2025, and your delays have caused significant financial and emotional hardship.

I demand that Progressive:
1. Immediately proceed with the salvage title process.
2. Finalize the total loss settlement and issue payment for the actual cash value of the vehicle.
3. Provide written confirmation of your compliance with Tennessee law regarding salvage titles.

If I do not receive a satisfactory resolution within 10 business days, I will escalate this matter to the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, the Attorney General‚Äôs Office, and pursue legal remedies.

Sincerely,  
Travis [Last Name]  
Policyholder
