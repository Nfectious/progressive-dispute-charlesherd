# Analysis of Stanley Coker’s Letter to TDCI

Stanley Coker’s June 23 letter to Bruce Moore (TDCI) makes three core assertions:

1. **Database Search & “Missing” Status**  
   Progressive claims it ran a “database search” showing Budget Rent-A-Car listed your Honda CR-V as “missing.”  
2. **Sale by Budget on June 28, 2024**  
   They assert Budget sold the vehicle to an “unknown party” on that date.  
3. **Lack of Title → No Coverage**  
   Based on the above, Progressive says you aren’t the legal owner, so they can’t pay you.

Each of these points is demonstrably false or unsupported—and collectively amount to misrepresentation.

## 1. “Database Search” & Missing-Vehicle Claim

• No record in law-enforcement databases, Carfax, or any VIN-reporting service ever flagged your CR-V as missing.  
• Matt Perkins sent you a “missing rental” image and phone number—but that number connected only to Carfax customer service, not Budget’s loss-control department.  
• **Conclusion:** There was no legitimate “database search.” Progressive relied on an unverified phone call, then mischaracterized it as a formal search. This is a material misrepresentation of fact.

## 2. Alleged Sale by Budget on June 28, 2024

• You purchased, possessed, and insured this vehicle continuously from 2023 through April 2025.  
• Budget Rent-A-Car cannot legally sell a car still in your possession, and they have no record of any sale to an “unknown party.”  
• Progressive provided no bill of sale, title transfer document, or lien release from Budget.  
• **Conclusion:** This claim is impossible and false. It appears designed to shift blame onto you and justify withholding settlement.

## 3. Impact on Your Coverage & Ownership

• Under **T.C.A. § 55-3-212**, once Progressive declared the vehicle a total loss and took possession, the **original title is void** and the insurer must secure the salvage certificate.  
• By insisting you produce a clear title or bond—after they took your car and declared it totaled—Progressive has created an impossible condition precedent.  
• **Conclusion:** Their instructions conflict with Tennessee law and their own policy acknowledgments. They’re misrepresenting your legal status to avoid payment.

# Legal Implications

- **Unfair Claims Settlement Practices (T.C.A. § 56-8-113):**  
  Misrepresenting pertinent facts or policy provisions with “such frequency as to indicate a general business practice.”  
- **Bad Faith & Fraud:**  
  Progressive’s false statements to both you and the state regulator may constitute insurance fraud and bad-faith handling.  
- **Statutory Penalties (T.C.A. § 56-7-105):**  
  Delays over 60 days expose them to a 25% penalty on the ACV plus attorney fees.
