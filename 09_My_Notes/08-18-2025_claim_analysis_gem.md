### **1.0 Executive Summary and Factual Chronology**

This report provides a detailed analysis of the claim dispute between Mr. Charles Herd and Progressive Casualty Insurance Company, as documented in the letter from Claims Manager Stanley Coker to the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance dated June 23, 2025 [1], and supplemented by Mr. Herd's extensive personal account and documentation. The analysis addresses Mr. Herd's concerns regarding seemingly contradictory information about his vehicle's ownership and status, as well as Progressive's handling of the claim and the significant personal hardship it has caused.

The core of the dispute centers on a broken chain of title for the 2020 Honda, which is a critical impediment to settling a total loss claim. The investigation reveals that while the initial discrepancies are rooted in complex corporate procedures, Progressive's handling of the claim has been marked by a pattern of conflicting advice, delays, and a failure to adhere to Tennessee law.[1] These actions have created a situation where Mr. Herd is being asked to perform a legally impossible task—obtaining a title for a totaled vehicle that is now in Progressive's possession. The legal and administrative responsibility for obtaining a salvage title shifted to Progressive once they took control of the vehicle.

A detailed chronology of the claim, incorporating both Progressive's and Mr. Herd's accounts, is provided in the table below to establish a clear timeline for the subsequent analysis.

### **2.0 Deconstructing the "Missing" Vehicle Designation and VIN Reports**

A central point of confusion for Mr. Herd is the discrepancy between Progressive's database search, which showed the car as "missing," and his own VIN reports and law enforcement checks, which yielded no such information.[1, 1, 1] This can be explained by the fundamental difference between public and private databases and the nature of internal corporate communications.

#### **2.1 The Distinction Between Public and Private Databases**

Law enforcement agencies maintain databases that are updated when a vehicle is officially reported stolen to the police. These systems are distinct from commercial databases. Services like the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) provide free VIN checks, but they only show if a vehicle has been reported as stolen or designated a salvage vehicle by a cooperating NICB member insurance company.[2] A vehicle is not flagged as "stolen" in these public systems until an official police report is filed.[2]

Commercial databases, such as those maintained by companies like Carfax, aggregate information from a much broader array of sources, including state Departments of Motor Vehicles (DMVs), collision repair centers, insurance companies, auction houses, and rental car companies.[3] Therefore, a VIN report from a commercial provider can contain information that is not present in official law enforcement records.[3]

#### **2.2 The Corporate 'Missing' Car Flag**

Progressive's letter states that their database searches showed the last official owner as Budget Rent A Car and that the vehicle was initially listed as "missing".[1] This "missing" status is not synonymous with a police-reported stolen vehicle. Large rental car companies operate vast fleets and use internal systems to track their assets.[4] When a vehicle is not returned by the due date, it is typically flagged within the company's own fleet management system as "missing" to initiate an internal recovery process.[5] This is a common operational procedure and may precede an official police report, which would be a more serious and legally significant step.[5]

The fact that Budget initially flagged the car as "missing" within its own system explains why Progressive's database search, which taps into these commercial information streams, would have found this status, while a query of an official law enforcement database would not.[3]

#### **2.3 Analysis of the Carfax Photo and Employee Communication**

Mr. Herd is logically correct in his assessment that Progressive's communication was misleading and not helpful.[1, 1] The action of providing a photo of a document with a Carfax Customer Service number on it, after over a month of Mr. Herd asking for proof of the "missing car" claim, could reasonably be viewed as an unhelpful and uncooperative lapse in communication.

It is a common misconception that services like Carfax are "public" databases; they are commercial, private services that aggregate data from a wide range of sources, including rental companies, while government and police databases typically only contain information on officially reported stolen vehicles.[2, 3] The record of a "missing rental" from Budget's perspective would therefore exist in these commercial databases but would not appear in a standard law enforcement check until a formal stolen vehicle report was filed. The lack of further explanation or documentation from Progressive's side when requested by Mr. Herd is a significant lapse in communication and may be considered an unfair claims practice.[6]

### **3.0 Insurable Interest, Title Ownership, and the Claim Timeline**

Mr. Herd's confusion is compounded by the apparent conflict between his possession of the car since 2023 and the claim that Budget Rent a Car sold it in June 2024.[1, 1] This section addresses this issue by clarifying the principle of insurable interest and the requirements for a total loss claim settlement.

#### **3.1 The Principle of Insurable Interest**

A fundamental principle in insurance law is "insurable interest," which means a person has a financial stake in a vehicle. An individual can purchase a car insurance policy even without a perfected title if they have an insurable interest.[7] In Mr. Herd's case, his possession and financial responsibility for the vehicle since 2023 gave him a valid insurable interest, which is why Progressive could legitimately collect insurance premiums from him.[7, 1] The act of collecting premiums on a car he had an insurable interest in is not fraudulent, as Progressive was fulfilling its obligation to provide coverage under the policy terms.[7] The issue of ownership did not become a problem until a total loss claim was filed, which triggered the need for a clear chain of title to process the settlement.

#### **3.2 The Imperative of a Perfected Title for Total Loss Claims**

For a total loss claim to be settled, the insurance company must legally take possession of the damaged vehicle.[1] The company then sells the vehicle for salvage, which is a standard method of mitigating their financial loss. To do this, the insurance company must receive a clear, perfected title from the policyholder, free from any liens or other encumbrances.

Mr. Herd correctly points out that he was initially willing to get a surety bond but was told by a Progressive agent that the company did not accept them, leading him to stop pursuing one.[1] This contradictory advice directly conflicts with Progressive's later demands and their claims of non-cooperation.[1]

Mr. Herd's understanding of Tennessee law is correct.[1] Under Tennessee law, if an insurance company "acquires ownership" of a vehicle deemed a total loss, the original title and registration are voided. The responsibility then shifts to the insurance company to notify the Department of Revenue and apply for a salvage certificate in its own name. Mr. Herd's point that the duty to obtain a salvage title falls to the insurance company because they have taken possession of the vehicle and declared it a total loss is legally sound. Progressive's continued demand that he obtain a surety bond or title for a car that has been legally voided and is in their possession is in direct conflict with state law.[1, 1]

#### **3.3 The Role and Purpose of a Surety Bond**

A surety bond is a legal instrument used to secure a title when a vehicle owner cannot produce the required ownership documents due to a lost, destroyed, or non-existent title. A bonded title serves as proof of ownership and is considered acceptable by state Departments of Motor Vehicles and insurance companies. This process involves a financial guarantee that, should a legal claim to the vehicle arise from a third party, the bond will protect the financial interests of both the new owner and the insurance company.

However, as Mr. Herd correctly asserts and Tennessee law confirms, a surety bond is no longer the appropriate legal path for a vehicle that has been declared a total loss and is in the possession of an insurer.[1] The original title has been voided by this action, and the next legal title type is a salvage title, which the insurance company is responsible for obtaining.

### **4.0 Deconstructing the "Sale to an Unknown Party"**

Mr. Herd's question about how a car rental company can sell a vehicle to an "unknown party" is a valid one, but the answer lies in understanding the complex processes of corporate asset disposition, which are far different from a typical private sale.

#### **4.1 The Rental Car Vehicle Lifecycle and Disposition**

Large rental car companies, such as Budget (part of Avis), operate on a high-volume business model. They purchase thousands of vehicles, use them for a relatively short period (often 1-3 years), and then systematically sell them to maintain a modern fleet. These cars are sold through several channels:

*   Directly to consumers through branded dealerships (e.g., Avis Car Sales).[8, 9]
*   Back to the manufacturer through "program car" agreements.[4]
*   To wholesale auctions and bulk buyers.[4]

The scale of these operations necessitates streamlined processes that are far different from a one-on-one sale between private individuals.

#### **4.2 How a Vehicle Can Be Sold to an "Unknown Party"**

A "sale to an unknown party" is a common occurrence in the business-to-business sector of the used car market, not necessarily a fraudulent one.[10, 11] When a company like Budget sells a vehicle to a wholesale auction or a dealer, the vehicle is often sold as part of a large lot.[4] To protect themselves from liability, sellers can file a "Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability" with the DMV.[10] In many states, this form can be completed with "unknown" in the buyer's name and address fields when the vehicle is transferred to an auction or a bulk buyer who has not yet perfected the title in their own name.[10, 11] This process effectively removes the seller's liability, shifting it to the next party.

The vehicle's journey likely proceeded as follows:
1.  Budget Rent A Car sold the vehicle to a wholesale auction or a bulk buyer (the "unknown party").
2.  The vehicle was then sold again from the auction/buyer to an individual or a small dealer.[4]
3.  This individual or dealer then sold it to the "social media party" who then sold it to Mr. Herd.[1]

At some point in this chain, the required title transfer paperwork was not properly completed, which is why Mr. Herd was unable to obtain a clear title and why the social media seller has since disappeared.[1] The "unknown party" is a sign of a broken chain of title, which is the root cause of the current dispute. The fact that the sale date, June 28, 2024, is after Mr. Herd's possession date in 2023, is the most confounding part of this narrative. It is possible there is a simple clerical error on Progressive's end or a misunderstanding of the information received from Budget, or that Budget's records are inaccurate.[1]

### **5.0 Legal and Regulatory Assessment of Allegations**

Mr. Herd's assertion that Progressive's actions constitute "bad faith" is supported by his documented timeline and the contradictory statements from Progressive's agents.

#### **5.1 Understanding "Bad Faith" Under Tennessee Law**

In Tennessee, insurance companies have a legal obligation to act in "good faith," which requires them to investigate and settle claims honestly and promptly.[12, 6] Acts of bad faith can include unreasonable delays, inadequate investigation, or refusal to pay a claim without a legitimate basis.[12, 6] The Tennessee Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act (T.C.A. § 56-8-105) outlines specific acts that constitute unfair practices, which can be used to support a bad faith claim. These include:

*   Knowingly misrepresenting relevant facts or policy provisions.
*   Failing to acknowledge with reasonable promptness pertinent communications.
*   Not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements when liability is reasonably clear.
*   Unreasonably delaying the investigation or payment of claims.

#### **5.2 Evaluation of Progressive's Claims Handling**

Based on Mr. Herd's documentation, Progressive's handling of the claim appears to meet the criteria for a pattern of "unfair claims practices" and could be construed as bad faith.[1] The evidence points to several key failures:

*   **Contradictory and Misleading Information**: Mr. Herd was initially told that Progressive would not accept a surety bond, only to be later told by a supervisor that one was required.[1] Progressive later admitted this was a "training error" and that no official policy on the matter existed.[1] This conflicting advice caused significant delay and confusion and may be seen as a misrepresentation of facts.
*   **False Claims of Non-Cooperation**: Progressive's letter to the state claims Mr. Herd was non-responsive for 16 days.[1] However, Mr. Herd's documentation shows a consistent pattern of communication via text and email with multiple agents during that period.[1, 1] Progressive also claims Mr. Herd "failed to cooperate with the assessment" and "has not returned calls".[1] This is contradicted by Mr. Herd's texts and emails, which show he made multiple attempts to communicate, and that Progressive was demanding statements he had already provided.[1]
*   **Demanding an Impossible Action**: Progressive is demanding that Mr. Herd obtain a surety bond or title for a vehicle that has been declared a total loss and is in their possession.[1, 1] This demand is legally baseless under T.C.A. § 55-3-212 and T.C.A. § 55-3-211, as the responsibility to obtain a salvage title now rests with them. This could be seen as an intentional delay tactic to avoid paying the claim.[12]
*   **Personal Hardship**: Mr. Herd's documented personal and financial hardships—including his health conditions (MS and Congestive Heart Failure), the emotional toll of his daughter's military deployment, and having to pay $950 out-of-pocket for a rental car—were communicated to Progressive but ignored.[1, 1] This failure to handle the claim promptly and fairly, knowing the significant hardship it was causing, is a strong factor in a bad-faith claim.[12]

The claim has now been open for almost five months without a resolution.[1] Tennessee law, specifically T.C.A. § 56-7-105, provides for additional liability upon insurers who, in bad faith, refuse to pay a loss within sixty days after a demand has been made. This penalty can be up to 25% of the amount the court finds the plaintiff is entitled to recover.

### **6.0 Revised Analysis and Actionable Plan**

Mr. Herd's points are not just valid; they are legally and factually sound. The original plan's core premise—that Mr. Herd should obtain a surety bond and a perfected title—is now invalid. Once Progressive took possession of the vehicle and declared it a total loss, the legal responsibilities shifted. It is legally and practically impossible for Mr. Herd to obtain a new title or a surety bond for a vehicle that has been voided and is no longer in his possession.

Here is a revised plan based on all the facts and the correct application of Tennessee law.

#### **6.1 A Revised, Actionable Plan for Mr. Herd**

1.  **Stop Pursuing a Bond or Title**: Mr. Herd should immediately cease all efforts to obtain a surety bond or title for the vehicle. This is no longer his legal or administrative responsibility. The original title was voided when Progressive declared the car a total loss and took possession of it. It is legally incorrect for Progressive to demand this of him.[1]
2.  **Issue a Formal Written Demand**: Mr. Herd should send a formal letter to Progressive's Claims Manager, Stanley Coker, and his supervisor, Matt Perkins. The letter should be sent via certified mail with a return receipt requested.
3.  **State Your Position and Cite the Law**: The letter should clearly state that Progressive has taken possession of the vehicle and has declared it a total loss.[1, 1, 1] Mr. Herd should cite Tennessee law (specifically T.C.A. § 55-3-212 and T.C.A. § 55-3-211) which states that when an insurer acquires ownership of a total loss vehicle, the original title is void, and the insurer becomes responsible for obtaining a salvage title. The letter should explicitly state that a bonded title is not legally applicable to a vehicle that has been declared a total loss.
4.  **Demand Payment**: The letter should formally demand that Progressive proceed with the claim settlement and pay the total loss value of the vehicle. It should also demand reimbursement for the $950 in out-of-pocket rental car expenses, citing the unreasonable delay caused by their contradictory advice and their failure to resolve the claim in a timely manner.[1, 1] Mr. Herd should explicitly state that this behavior constitutes a pattern of "unfair claims practices" under Tennessee law and that he is demanding a penalty for bad-faith handling, which under T.C.A. § 56-7-105 can be up to 25% of the claim amount.
5.  **Set a Deadline**: Mr. Herd should give Progressive a clear, reasonable deadline (e.g., 10-15 business days) to respond and provide a resolution.
6.  **File an Official Complaint**: If Progressive fails to respond or refuses to act by the specified deadline, Mr. Herd should immediately file a formal, detailed complaint with the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance. He should include all documentation, including his personal timeline, the total loss estimate, the letter he sent to Progressive, and all email and text correspondence, to demonstrate a clear pattern of unfair claims practices and a violation of state law.[1, 1] He should also include his experience with the state agent, as it provides a complete record of his interactions.[1, 1]

This revised plan empowers Mr. Herd by focusing on Progressive's legal obligations under Tennessee law, rather than his. The burden of proof now shifts to the insurer to explain why they continue to demand a title for a vehicle they possess, which they have declared a total loss.
