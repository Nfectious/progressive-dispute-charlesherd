Understood. I’ll conduct a deep analysis of the August 6 Reservation of Rights letter from Progressive related to the rental car incident and evaluate it under Tennessee insurance law. I’ll identify where Progressive’s position may fail legally or procedurally, and determine your recourse options—especially in light of your out-of-pocket rental, unknown policy removal by your mother, and lack of final settlement on your totaled Honda.

I’ll get back to you with an action-ready summary, legal footing under Tennessee statutes, and next tactical steps.
