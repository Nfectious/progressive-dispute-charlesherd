5/20/25,Matt Perkins (Supervisor),Called Matt Perkins: Returned Mr. Perkins phone call where he told me he would be handling the claim.  Mr Perkins at this time asked to be provided with VIN reports I had ran in which I provided.  Mr Perkins at that time also stated that the vehicle  was  “reported missing” by Budget – I asked to see documentation from him regarding this in which he provided none because is was false and so Mr. Perkins could not provide anything regarding what he said
5/20/25,Email from Mr. Perkins,Mr. Perkins sent email asking for documents pertaining to the vehicle
5/20/25,Email to Mr. Perkins,"I emailed Mrl Perkins the documents I could find and told him I would send more once I found them, again asked to receive documents regarding him saying the vehicle was reported missing and still no reply from Mr. Perkins regarding that."
5/20/25,Call from Mr. Perkins,"Received a call from Mr Perkins regarding turning the rental in despite the claim still open and I was told the policy is 3 days after claim is final or 30 days, and my 30 days was up and I needed to return the rental despite anything else stating policy was the reason."
5/21/25,Email to Mr. Perkins,"I emailed Mr. Perkins about returning the rental car before the claim had been finished and that it would leave me without a vehicle, and I had no ride after dropping the rental off.  I sent a total of 3 emails to Mr Perkins who only responded to one when I asked why I was charged for a portion of the rental car they provided."
5/21/25,Email From Mr. Perkins,"Received email from Mr. Perkins only regarding the charges I paid for the rental they provided, and was told because I picked a certain vehicle was I charged.  At no time was I ever told I had to pick a certain vehicle and took the one the rental provided.  How was I to know I had to pick a certain vehicle."
5/22/25,Email from Mr. Perkins,"Reveived email from Mr Perkins telling me to submit  a copy of what I had paid Enterprise for the rental to be reimberssed only to later be told  no becasue of the vehicle the rental company provided me. I didn't know I could pick a vehilce and took the vehicle the rental company provied.  The email also said Progressive was still investivgating my claim and if I wished to expedite the process to pursue getting a bonded title.  I was told previously by Kim that a bonded title was not acceptable by Progressives policy and they could not accept one.  Now her supervisor Mr. Perkins has told me if I obtained one it would expedite the claim.  I still have yet to receive any documentation regarding what Mr. Perkins said about the vehicle being reported in 2023, and now he has asked me to obtain something to help me out when previously had been told it was against Progressives policy to accept what Mr. Perkins was asking me to obtain."
5/22/25,Email to Mr. Perkins,I emailed Mr Perkins about the rental and claim without a response.
5/23/25,Email to Mr. Perkins,I emailed Mr. Perkins again about my claim and have yet to receive a response.
5/27/25,Voicemail from Kim,Received a voicemail from Kim stating that now the “Vehicle not declared total loss yet” — contradicts text
5/27/25,Emal from Mr. Perkins,"Matt Perkins' email introduces a significant new condition and contradicts previous information you received from another Progressive agent Key Issues Arising from Matt Perkins' Email: 1. Shift in Blame/Responsibility: Progressive is now placing the onus entirely on you to secure a title (potentially via a surety bond) before they will process your claim. 2. Contradictory Advice on Surety Bonds: Matt Perkins is instructing you to ""proceed with acquiring one"" if a surety bond is required for the title. This directly contradicts what Kim previously told you – that a bonded title was ""not acceptable by Progressives policy"". This contradiction is a critical point to address. 3. Conditional Claim Processing: Payment of your claim is now contingent on you providing this title. 4. Questioning Ownership: They state, ""we don't have documentation confirming that you are the owner,"" despite insuring the vehicle for you for almost two years based on the VIN you provided and accepting your premium payments. 5. Vehicle Status Still Unclear: While Matt mentions the ""vehicle is being inspected to determine the settlement value"" (which usually happens in a total loss scenario), the overall claim resolution is now tied to the title issue, which sidesteps a clear confirmation of the total loss status that Kim had initially provided via text  and then recently cast doubt on via voicemail. 6. Offer to Return Vehicle: The offer to tow the vehicle back to you if you can't provide ""proof of ownership"" seems like an attempt to wash their hands of the claim if you can't meet their new demand."
