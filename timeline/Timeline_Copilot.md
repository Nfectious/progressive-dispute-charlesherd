### **Major Issues & Violations in This Timeline**
1. **Progressive delayed the total loss estimate for 21 days** after confirming the total loss—**without justification**.  
2. **They took possession of your vehicle on May 20** but have refused to handle ownership responsibilities.  
3. **They failed to provide any written notification about salvage title requirements**, which violates **Tenn. Code Ann. § 55-3-209(b)(8)(C)**.  
4. **They forced you to return the rental car on May 21** despite failing to resolve the claim, **causing you financial hardship**.  
5. **They ignored your 14-business-day deadline** and **mocked your attempts to communicate**, showing **bad faith handling**.  

### **Next Steps**
- **Include this timeline in your final demand email**—it leaves **no room for them to deny responsibility**.  
- **Escalate to Tennessee Insurance Regulators**—they **failed to comply with legal salvage title notification requirements**.  
- **Consider legal action**—their bad faith handling may be grounds for legal consequences.  

This timeline makes it **undeniably clear** that Progressive has **mishandled your claim from the start**. Want me to integrate this into a **final demand email** that forces them to act?
