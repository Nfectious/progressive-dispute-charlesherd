You’re absolutely right—it’s impossible for you to post a bond or get a title on a car you no longer possess and that Progressive has already deemed a total loss. Legally, once they declared it a total loss and took possession, the insurer—not you—must handle the salvage title. Here’s exactly what to do:

---  
## 1. Draft a Formal Rebuttal to Their Bond/Title Demand  
Send a short letter or email back to your adjuster (and copy the Claims Manager) that says:

1. “On May 19–20, 2025, Progressive took possession of my 2020 Honda CR-V (VIN …) and transported it to Copart.  
2. Under **T.C.A. § 55-3-212**, once a vehicle is declared a total loss, the original title is void and the insurer is responsible for obtaining the salvage certificate.  
3. Under **T.C.A. § 55-3-211(9)(A)**, because Progressive declared the vehicle a total loss and has had possession since May, you must apply for and issue the salvage title—policyholder bonding is not required.  
4. Therefore, I cannot and will not post any surety bond or obtain a title. Please confirm in writing by [date in 5 business days] how Progressive will comply with its statutory duty to process the salvage title and issue my ACV payment.”  

That letter accomplishes three things:  
- Puts them on notice that you know the law.  
- Shuts down their impossible bond request.  
- Forces them to explain how *they* will process the title and pay you.  

---  
## 2. Reference Their Own “Reservation of Rights” Warning  
At the bottom of their Reservation of Rights letter, they warn *you* that misrepresenting facts is fraud. Flip that back on them:

> “Progressive’s own fraud warning applies to its agents. When Matt Perkins told me the vehicle was ‘reported missing’ by Budget—based on a phone call, not a database search, and without producing any documentation—that was a material misrepresentation. I expect Progressive to honor its own zero-fraud policy and provide truthful, actionable instructions.”  

---  
## 3. Escalate If They Refuse  
If they push back or give you another “bond us” line:

- **Reply**: “That instruction is legally invalid. Please confirm your statutory compliance by [deadline].”  
- **Next**: File or supplement your regulatory complaint with TDCI and the TN Attorney General, attaching your rebuttal and citing the relevant statutes.  
- **Last resort**: Threaten bad-faith litigation under **T.C.A. § 56-8-113** and the 25% penalty for delays under **T.C.A. § 56-7-105**.  

---  
## 4. Sample Rebuttal Language  
You can copy-paste this into your email or letter:

> Progressive Claims Department,  
>  
> Re: 2020 Honda CR-V (VIN …), Claim #25-822866566  
>  
> Progressive took possession of my vehicle on May 20, 2025, and declared it a total loss on May 6, 2025. Under Tennessee law—specifically T.C.A. § 55-3-212 and § 55-3-211(9)(A)—the insurer is required to obtain the salvage certificate and handle title processing once a vehicle is totaled and in the insurer’s possession.  
>  
> I therefore cannot and will not post a surety bond or obtain a new title. Please confirm in writing by [date] how Progressive will comply with its statutory duty to process the salvage title and issue my Actual Cash Value payment.  
>  
> Sincerely,  
> Travis Herd

By forcing them to put their plan in writing—and tying it to the statutes—you remove all pretext. They must either process the salvage title and pay your claim or admit bad faith. From there, you can escalate to regulators or court with a clear record of their refusal.
